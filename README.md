## Implementation Details
- **Video Playback:** Video playback is managed using the video_player package. The VideoPlayerWidget is designed to handle play/pause functionality and display custom progress indicators.

## Future Enhancements
- **Offline Caching:** Implement offline caching for videos to improve load times and provide a better user experience in low-connectivity environments.
- **Interactive Features:** Add interactive features such as comments, likes, and sharing directly from the video feed.
- **Performance Optimization:** Further optimize video loading and buffering for smoother playback.
